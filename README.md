# Hi, I'm Dev. I do many things.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a software engineer, security researcher, and developer. My tech background is originally in ethical hacking and has shifted towards software engineering/development
as I progress in my journey. I've worked on several projects ranging from comprehensive software designed to hack RF systems such as RKE systems and ADS-B transponders
in planes within the same suite to normal website and application development for small businesses. I'm a public speaker too, having spoken at Commonwealth University
on my research development 3 separate times. Personally I am currently using Gentoo Linux as my main Operating System with Windows 11 dual booted. 
I'm an advocate for free software and individual privacy rights.
